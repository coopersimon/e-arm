- Experimental JIT compilation targeting x86-64, for ARMv4.
- Thumb decoding support.
- Implementation of ARM7TDMI and ARM9xxE-S
- Memory & coprocessor interfaces, with access types.
- Cycle counting.
- Exceptions.
- Formatting of instructions.

## TODO
- JIT optimisation and bugfixes.
- JIT support for ARMv5.
- Correct interlocking cycle counting for ARMv5.
